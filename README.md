### Features Left to Implement

- Individual pages for each service will be added in future as opposed to the links to wikipedia
- A Projects page will be added to highlight some recent projects which the company has successfully undertaken.

## Testing 

- Testing was carried out on all three pages of the website. The testing was carried out on the following devices:
  - Desktop
  - Tablet
  - Mobile

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
